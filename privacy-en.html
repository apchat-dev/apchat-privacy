  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: October 16, 2025</p>

  <p>APChat (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the APChat mobile application (“App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal information directly from users. All accounts are created and managed by authorized administrators. During account creation, we may store limited information such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phone number (for account identification and login)</li>
    <li>User name and profile details provided by the administrator</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The information stored in APChat is used solely to provide secure access to the chat platform and enable communication features within the App.</p>

  <h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver push notifications related to chat activity and system updates. Firebase may collect non-personal usage data to ensure reliable message delivery.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or rent any user data to third parties. Access to user data is limited to authorized administrators within the organization.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All user data is stored securely on servers managed by our organization. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>User information will be retained only for as long as necessary for internal communication purposes or as required by applicable laws.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since accounts are created by administrators, users who wish to update, correct, or delete their information may contact their administrator for assistance.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with the updated revision date.</p>
