  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 16, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>APChat</strong> (“<em>we</em>,” “<em>our</em>,” or “<em>us</em>”) collects, uses, and protects personal information in connection with the APChat mobile application (“<em>App</em>”). We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly and securely.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect personal information directly from users. All user accounts are created and managed exclusively by authorized administrators. During account setup, limited information may be stored, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Phone number (for user identification and login purposes)</li>
    <li>Username and profile details provided by the administrator</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The information stored within APChat is used solely to enable secure user authentication and facilitate communication functions within the App. We do not use personal information for marketing, analytics, or any unrelated purposes.</p>

  <h2>3. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>We utilize <strong>Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</strong> to deliver push notifications regarding chat activity and system updates. Firebase may collect non-personal usage data to support reliable message delivery. No personally identifiable information is shared with Firebase beyond what is required for the service to function.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or rent user information to any third parties. Access to user data is restricted to authorized administrators within the organization and is used strictly for internal operational purposes.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All user information is securely stored on servers managed by our organization. We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>User information is retained only for as long as necessary to support internal communication needs or as required by applicable laws and regulations. When data is no longer needed, it will be securely deleted or anonymized.</p>

  <h2>7. User Rights and Access</h2>
  <p>Because all accounts are created by administrators, users who wish to review, correct, or delete their personal information may contact their respective administrator for assistance. We will support such requests to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. Updated versions will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. Users are encouraged to review this page periodically for any updates.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at:</p>
